First, the user is asked to enter their name, how many players they want
at the table and how many chips to start with. Based off of that info players
are created and added to the table.

We then start playing a game at the table.
In the table there is a method called playGame() that calls all the other methods
needed to pay the game. I first create an array called aroundTable. This holds all the
people who still have money to play poker. Then we deal cards to the people in this
array. Next we get their odds of winning. This is done by making a call to the pokerAPI
and then calling a method in Player which determines if the player will play this
hand based off of their play style. Next we make bets, check or fold.
Then the flop is laid and we again get odd and make our bet, check or fold.
Another card is laid down and we get odds and decide to play.
Finally the last card is laid and we determine the winner. All of the cards that
belong to people still playing the game are collected and sent to the API.
After we have a winner, we clean up the table by checking if there are any players with no money left.

We continue to play the game until there is only one person with money. Then the world
champion winner is displayed and the user is asked if they want to play again.

The screen will display the following:
Dealer
User's cards:
Player's thinking.. (When the player is getting their odds)
Player's placing bet and then the chips they have left
or Player's checking..
or Player's out..

Then they continue to play if people still have money or the user is asked if they
want to quit.
